# data-exporters

The `data-exporters` tree provides endpoints for querying potentially-dynamic data from the site and processing it record-by-record.

The `/exports` web interface provides a menu of available data exporters with query forms and output to streaming CSV.

Data warehouse exporters are available as well that can declaratively map output sets and attributes to external PostgreSQL tables and columns.
