# cypress

The `cypress` root contains end-to-end testing assets for the [Cypress browser testing framework](https://www.cypress.io/). It follows the same structure that Cypress' command-line tooling will generate in a project repository by default.

See [Cypress' *Folder Structure* documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests#Folder-structure) for details on the semantics of content within this tree.
