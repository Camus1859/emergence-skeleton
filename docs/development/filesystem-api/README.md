# Filesystem API

This section documents the `emergence-site-v1` filesystem API.

The filesystem API consists of a declared set of standard root filesystem tree names for a site. Each standard root is associated with a definition of how files within should be named and structured, and how the site should incorporate the contents of the tree into its behavior.
