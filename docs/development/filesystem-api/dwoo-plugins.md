# dwoo-plugins

The `dwoo-plugins` root provides a way to extend the Dwoo templating language with new functions/plugins that can be called from within any template.

Placing a file under this directory is enough to register a new plugin and make it usable, with the filename serving as the function name you can invoke the plugin with inside templates.
