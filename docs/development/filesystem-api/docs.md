# docs

The `docs` root contains documentation content for the project in Markdown format, commonly compiled with MkDocs into a static website.

Sites can add files to this tree with any path and name to create arbitrary articles, but the following convention is recommended for typical documentation:

- `getting-started/`: initial setup for a new system
- `usage/`: content for users of the system
- `development/`: content for developers making changes to the system
- `operations/`: content for systems administrators maintaining the system
